# BotConsole

## Overview
BotConsole is a console application designed to demonstrate the capabilities of a simple ant+ powermeter bot. It is built using .NET Framework 4.8.1.

## Features
- Basic ant+ powermeter/cadence bot
- Random noise so that it doesn't look too obviously like a bot
- Joule/watt limits so that it doesn't exceed 20m power thresholds
 
## Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.0 or .NET Framework 4.8.1
- Visual Studio

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore the necessary packages.
4. Extract the ant+ libraries from thisisant.com to the correct location.

4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

## Future Enhancements
* Drafting logic
* Hill detction
* TT mode
* Joule/watt limits so that it doesn't exceed 5m power thresholds
